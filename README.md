# 🤖 Agentic LLM System

A lightweight, intelligent agent that processes user input, determines intent, and returns appropriate responses using OpenAI's language models. The system automatically classifies queries as either factual or creative and responds accordingly while maintaining conversation memory.

## 🎯 **System Objective**

Build a lightweight agent that:
- ✅ Processes user input and determines intent
- ✅ Classifies input as factual queries or creative prompts  
- ✅ Returns appropriate responses based on classification
- ✅ Maintains basic memory across 2-3 interactions
- ✅ Uses modular, maintainable code structure

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### Core Components

1. **Intent Detection Engine**: Uses OpenAI GPT to classify user input
2. **Response Generation System**: Separate pipelines for factual vs creative responses
3. **Memory Management**: Stores last 3 interactions for context-aware responses
4. **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with comprehensive error handling

### System Flow

```
User Input → Intent Detection → Response Generation → Memory Storage → Output
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                 ↓            ↓
  "Who is..."   [factual]        Factual Pipeline    Store Context   Direct Answer
  "Write a..."  [creative]       Creative Pipeline   Store Context   Creative Content
```

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone/Download the code**

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your OpenAI API key:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the system:**
   ```bash
   python agentic_llm.py
   ```

### Usage Modes

The system offers three usage modes:

1. **Comprehensive Testing** - Runs 25+ automated test cases
2. **Interactive Mode** - Chat interface for real-time interaction  
3. **Quick Demo** - 4 example interactions to see the system in action

## 💡 **How It Works**

### Intent Detection

The system uses OpenAI's GPT model to classify user input into two categories:

**Factual Queries:**
- Information requests: "Who is the CEO of Google?"
- Definitions: "What is machine learning?"
- Historical facts: "When was Python created?"
- Technical questions: "How many continents are there?"

**Creative Prompts:**
- Content generation: "Write a poem about rain"
- Creative descriptions: "Give me a caption for a futuristic city"
- Storytelling: "Create a story about a robot"
- Brainstorming: "Generate names for a startup"

### Response Generation

**For Factual Queries:**
- Temperature: 0.2 (more deterministic)
- Focus: Accuracy, precision, informativeness
- Style: Direct, concise, fact-based

**For Creative Prompts:**
- Temperature: 0.8 (more creative)
- Focus: Originality, engagement, imagination
- Style: Creative, expressive, engaging

### Memory Management

- **Capacity**: Stores last 3 interactions automatically
- **Context Integration**: Previous conversations inform current responses
- **Memory Commands**: View, clear, and analyze conversation history

## 🧪 **Test Cases Covered**

The system includes comprehensive testing across multiple categories:

### Factual Query Tests
- **Basic Facts**: CEO queries, capitals, scientific constants
- **Definitions**: Technical terms, concepts, acronyms
- **Historical**: Dates, events, inventions
- **Technical**: Programming, science, mathematics

### Creative Prompt Tests
- **Captions & Descriptions**: Visual descriptions, taglines
- **Stories & Poems**: Creative writing, haikus, narratives
- **Brainstorming**: Ideas, names, concepts

### Edge Cases
- **Ambiguous Input**: Mixed intent, unclear requests
- **Minimal Input**: Single words, greetings
- **Complex Requests**: Multi-part questions

### Memory & Context Tests
- **Follow-up Questions**: Reference previous topics
- **Context Switching**: Changing subjects mid-conversation
- **Memory Persistence**: Information retention across interactions

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### LLM Integration (OpenAI)

```python
# Intent Classification
model="gpt-3.5-turbo"
temperature=0.1  # Low for consistent classification
max_tokens=10    # Minimal for "factual" or "creative"

# Factual Responses  
temperature=0.2  # Lower for accuracy
max_tokens=250   # Sufficient for detailed answers

# Creative Responses
temperature=0.8  # Higher for creativity
max_tokens=250   # Room for creative expression
```

### Prompt Engineering

**Intent Classification Prompt:**
- Clear category definitions
- Examples of each type
- Single-word response requirement
- Robust handling of edge cases

**Response Generation Prompts:**
- Context integration from memory
- Clear role definitions
- Appropriate tone and style instructions
- Error handling and fallback responses

### Memory Architecture

```python
# Circular buffer implementation
memory = deque(maxlen=3)

# Interaction storage
{
    'user_input': str,
    'response': str, 
    'intent': str,
    'timestamp': float
}
```

## 📊 **Example Interactions**

### Factual Query Example
```
User: Who is the CEO of Google?
Intent: factual
Agent: Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google. He has been leading the company since 2015...
```

### Creative Prompt Example
```
User: Give me a caption for a futuristic city
Intent: creative  
Agent: "Neon dreams pierce the endless night—welcome to Neo-Tokyo 2084, where humanity and technology dance in perfect harmony."
```

### Memory Context Example
```
User: Tell me about Einstein
Agent: Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist best known for his theory of relativity...

User: What did he discover?
Agent: Building on our previous discussion about Einstein, his most famous discoveries include...
```

## 🛠️ **Configuration Options**

### Model Selection
```python
agent = AgenticLLM(model="gpt-4")  # Use GPT-4 for better performance
agent = AgenticLLM(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")  # Default, cost-effective
```

### Memory Capacity
```python
agent = AgenticLLM(memory_size=5)  # Store 5 interactions instead of 3
```

### Logging Level
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # Detailed logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)  # Minimal logging
```

## 🔍 **Error Handling & Robustness**

- **API Failures**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages
- **Invalid Input**: Handles empty, null, or malformed input
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between requests during testing
- **Intent Classification**: Defaults to 'factual' for ambiguous cases
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and capacity management

## 📈 **Performance Considerations**

- **Response Time**: ~1-3 seconds per interaction (depends on OpenAI API)
- **Cost Optimization**: Uses gpt-3.5-turbo by default for cost efficiency
- **Rate Limiting**: Includes delays to respect API limits
- **Memory Efficiency**: Circular buffer prevents unbounded memory growth

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

**Potential Improvements:**
- Support for other LLM providers (Anthropic, Mistral, local models)
- Persistent memory storage (database integration)
- Multi-turn conversation planning
- Custom intent categories
- Response quality scoring
- Voice/audio input support
